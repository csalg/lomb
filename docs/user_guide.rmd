Lomb is an app to learn languages through reading texts. The main idea behind Lomb is to use the interaction data generated while a user reads to predict which words should be revised. 

Using the app is quite simple:

# 1. Registration

![Register](./img/registration.png)

Open the registration tab and introduce your user details. Don't use a sensitive password because the server is not security hardened.

The most important information at this stage is your 'learning languages' and 'known languages'. 'Learning languages' refers to languages you are learning / interested in learning whereas 'known languages' are used for translations/definitions.


# 2. Selecting a text to read.

This is very easy, just select from the 'Read' area.

# 3. Using the reader.

The reader is intuitive to use but requires some explanation. It is divided into three areas: a reader area, a sentence translation panel (which is on top of the reader) and a definition panel (which makes up the right half of the screen).

On loading a text you might need to wait up to 10 seconds for the styling to be applied to the text. After that it can be read like any other document, with some additional actions:

- Clicking on a sentence will show its translation on the translation panel.
- Selecting (highlighting a word) will show its definition on the definition panel.
- Scrolling down will make sentences which have been read but not clicked turn blue.

# 4. Revision

All words which are highlighted are added to your learning vocabulary by default, and they can be revised in the 'Revision' section.

There are two parameters which you can use to personalize the revision session:

- Frequency, which is a measure of how important a word is (more frequent words should be studied first). If you only have five minutes to revise, simply use the slider to study only words which are very frequent and leave the more uncommon words for some other time.
- Probability of recall (PoR), which is an estimate of how likely you are to remember a word. Typically, words which have not been read or reviewed in a long time will be displayed first. Most users will remember words with high PoR, which will typically be the majority of your learning words, so these can be conveniently filtered out.

To revise, simply scroll down and try to remember what the words mean. If you can't remember what a word means, click on it and a dictionary entry will appear, along with many examples from the texts in the database.
